<h2> About Me </h2>

I am a full-stack developer with 3 years experience of mostly Java back-end development. 
I have also worked with Typescript, React, Python, some cloud services and LangChain with MistralAI. 
I'm currently learning Angular and front end testing. 
When afk I enjoy going on long runs, reading and drinking far too much tea.
